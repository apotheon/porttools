- Include patches from svn://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head/ports-mgmt/porttools/files/*
  in original files, open github repository. 

0.99, 2009-09-09
- bugfix: Fix commandline arguments handling for some cases when two or more 
  flags are used - e.g. `port submit -m update -d .orig` (PR: ports/100771,
  thanks HASHI Hiroaki and Dmitry Marakasov)
- optimization: add -R flag to cvs(1) invocation in port diff - this would
  allow working against a local read-only repository and improve performance
  (PR: ports/116248, thanks Xin LI)
- update copyright notices

0.77, 2006-05-06
- bugfix: port create: quote arguments passed to newfile(1) - otherwise
  a space in FULLNAME will mess up other arguments (thanks Radim Kolar)

0.76, 2006-05-02
- bugfix: port submit: integrate patch from the ports tree: modify util_diff
  to work correctly for p5-/py-/ruby- ports (i.e. PKGNAMEPREFIX is not empty).
  This fixes both detection of ORIG_DIR and Synopsis field generation for such
  ports (PR: ports/70156, Cheng-Lung Sung)
- bugfix: port create: use author's name and e-mail address from ~/.porttools
  when creating a new port (PR: ports/70300, Janos Mohacsi)
- bugfix: port test: integrate patch from the ports tree: add detection
  of leftover directories in addition to leftover files (PR: ports/71363,
  Yen-Ming Lee)
- bugfix: port submit: avoid CC'ing PRs with maintainership changes to
  previous maintainer if the port was unmaintained - i.e. when MAINTAINER
  is set to ports@FreeBSD.org (PR: ports/94055, Diane Bruce)

0.75, 2006-05-01
- new: port commit: commit the port to FreeBSD CVS repository

  installation of dependencies into the temporary PREFIX dir
- change: port test: optimize shared library dependency search algorithm
  by only searching for files listed in the package's plist
- new: port test: if 'make package' phase fails (most often because of
  stale files listed in pkg-plist which are no longer installed) display
  a list currently installed in the PREFIX before cleaning up
- cosmetique: change man pages to my FreeBSD.org e-mail address
- cosmetique: change copyright in README for year 2004

  PREFIX if PREFIX == LOCALBASE

- change: LICENSE: update copyright for year 2004

0.60, 2004-07-29
- add: port submit: new option: -c (committer check): adds "-c" to portlint(1)
  flags when checking the port for sanity before submitting 
  (previously "-c" was always added - could cause problems with recent
  portlint versions)
- change: port test: change portlint(1) flags from "-abct" to "-abt"
- change: port test: avoid using commas and plus signs when generating PREFIX
  (some ports breaks with such PREFIX)
- change: port test: avoid deleting PREFIX before and after port test
  if installing into LOCALBASE or X11BASE (ouch!)
- add: port test: before deinstall, use pkg_info(1) to output line
  with PKGNAME and COMMENT to check against provided in Makefile
  (mostly for COMMENT truncation cases)
  NOTE: this should really be checked by portlint(1)
- add: port test: before deinstall, run ldd(1) on each installed binary
  to depend any hidden (or improper) shared library dependencies
- change: port test: remove PREFIX from the list of extra files
  (for easier copy-and-pasting into pkg-plist)
- bugfix: util_diff: use PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX to determine the
  original port dir if diff'ing in non-CVS mode (reported by many)
- change: util_diff: add "-N" to "cvs diff" options to include newly created
  files in the diff (suggested by Tim Bishop - thanks!)
- change: port submit: extend functionality of added/deleted files
  detection to work in non-CVS mode, too - patch provided by Sergey
  Matveychuk (thanks!); closes #995048
- bugfix: port submit: fix update and change maintainer detection 
  by properly escape awk regexp (thanks, Sergey!)

  port(1) front-end
- new: "plug-in" command scripts, located in ${PREFIX}/share/porttools
- new: commands: 
	- create - creates new port directory from a template
	- diff - generate a diff (in the same way as "port submit" would)
	- fetch - fetch a new version of the port
- change: pr-change, pr-new and pr-update are combined into "port submit",
  which determines the mode automatically
- change: port submit: improve detection of requests to take maintainership
  (prompted by Sergey Matveychuk)
- new: port submit: add detection for added/removed files
  (tested only with CVS diff mode)
- new: port submit: add option (-L) to skip running portlint (thanks, Sergey!)
- change: testport: renamed to port test
- change: port test: filter out share/nls/{POSIX,en_US.US-ASCII} from extra 
  files check (should really be fixed in the mtree)
- change: pr-new.1, pr-change.1, pr-update.1, and testport.1 were merged into
  single manual page - port.1
- new: porttools.1: new manual page describing ~/.porttools config file format

  port from now on; Makefile is no longer included with the distribution
- new: added manpages
- change: testport was converted to use getopt(1)
- new: pr-update now accepts command-line arguments using getopt(1):
  -m mode, -s severity, -p priority

  -l - stop after running portlint(1)
  -L - do NOT run portlint(1)

- bugfix: testport: do not check for extra files if $PREFIX does not exist

0.16, 2003-07-21

  PR form respectively
- fix bug which prevented submitted patch to be saved in ${ARCHIVE_DIR}

0.10, 2003-06-25
- add configuration file (~/.porttools), generated automatically if it does not exist
- pr-update, pr-change, pr-new are symlinks to a single script, mode detected based on $0
- do not use send-pr.template anymore - instead, PR form is generated from by the script
- cleanup after aborted send-pr(1) - delete generated files and /tmp/pbad.*
- testport uses configuration file, too
- testport: BUILDROOT can override where PREFIX is located (default: in /tmp)
- testport: allow running several testport processes - use PREFIX=${BUILDROOT}/${PKGNAME}
  (instead of /tmp/${PORTNAME}) and mktemp(1)-ed PKG_DBDIR
