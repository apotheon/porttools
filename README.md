FreeBSD Port Tools
==================


Introduction
------------

FreeBSD Port Tools consist of the several small scripts run from
`port(1)` front-end:
- `port commit`: commit a port into the FreeBSD Ports SVN Repository
- `port create`: create a new port from a template
- `port diff`: generate a diff against a previous version of the port
- `port fetch`: fetch distfile(s) of a new version of the port
- `port getpr`: get patch/shar from a PR
- `port help`: display usage summary for `port(1)` commands
- `port install`: install a port
- `port submit`: submit a PR with new port, or port change/update
- `port test`: automate testing a new port or a port update
- `port upgrade`: upgrade a port

FreeBSD Port Tools were originally available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/porttools/>
but went unmaintained for too long, so I decided to fork the project and put it
on Github.

Usage
-----

Let us assume you are interested in helping out with one of the ports.
The most convenient way of doing that with the Port Tools is the following.
Even though the Port Tools have 3 most of diff generation, the recommended is 
SVN (default). Do not be scared away at this point - it is very simple.
Let me give a quick overview:

1. Check out a working copy of the port. I usually do it in `~/ports` directory:
   (NOTE: my `~/ports` directory contains only those ports I am interested in,
   i.e. either maitain or send changes/updates to. Thus, it does not have
   to contain the whole FreeBSD Ports tree)

```
   xmj@mx12:~% cd ~/ports
   xmj@mx12:~/ports% svn co ipsvd
```

   `ipsvd` is the sample port name.

2. Now, make your changes - e.g. change PORTVERSION from `0.6.0` to `0.6.1`.


```
   xmj@mx12:~/ports/ipsvd% cd ipsvd
   xmj@mx12:~/ports/ipsvd% vim Makefile
```

3. At this moment we need to fetch the new distfile and run `make makesum`
   to update the distinfo file. There is even simpler way to accomplish this 
   with the Port Tools version `0.50` or later:

```
   xmj@mx12:~/ports/ipsvd% port fetch
```

4. Now we want to make sure that the port compiles, installs and works fine:

```
   xmj@mx12:~/ports/ipsvd% port test
```

5. Once I am satisfied with the results, let us submit a PR 
   with the port update:

```
   xmj@mx12:~/ports/ipsvd% port submit
```

Now, this was a very simple case, and it did not show off all the features 
of the Port Tools, so please check `port(1)` manual page for details.
